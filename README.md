# **Machine Learning Model for Financial Data Prediction**

A predictive model for forecasting **Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock prices** using a combination of **statistical and machine learning techniques**.

---

## **1. Project Overview**

This project explores the application of **machine learning models** for predicting financial data, specifically **Tesla Inc. (TSLA) stock prices**. It integrates **traditional statistical methods (ARIMA)** and **modern machine learning techniques (XGBoost and Transformers)** to build a **robust predictive model**. The aim is to address the complexities of financial forecasting by incorporating **both linear and non-linear modelling approaches**.

---

## **2. Technology Stack**

The system leverages the following technologies:

### **Time Series Modelling**

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** – Captures linear time series trends and patterns.
- **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** – Handles non-linear relationships and enhances model performance.
- **Transformer-based Neural Networks** – Implements deep learning for understanding long-term dependencies in stock price movements.

### **Data Processing**

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)** – Data manipulation, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualisation and performance evaluation.

### **Model Training & Evaluation**

- **Cross-validation & Hyperparameter Tuning** – Ensures generalisation and prevents overfitting.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE) & Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Evaluates model accuracy.

---

## **3. Core Methodology**

The system follows a **hybrid approach** that integrates traditional statistical models with machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

### **Understanding the Problem**

Financial data is highly **volatile and non-stationary**, influenced by external factors such as:

- **Economic indicators**
- **Investor sentiment**
- **Global political events**
- **Company earnings reports**

Traditional time series forecasting models like **ARIMA** struggle to capture **complex, non-linear relationships** present in financial data. Therefore, this project extends the approach by incorporating **XGBoost** and **Transformer-based models**.

---

### **Model Selection & Rationale**

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**

   - Captures **linear trends** and historical patterns in stock price data.
   - Uses **differencing** to address non-stationarity.
   - Defined by the equation:

     $$
     y_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i y_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^{q} \theta_i \epsilon_{t-i} + \epsilon_t
     $$

     Where:

     - \( y_t \) is the differenced time series.
     - \( \phi_i \) are autoregressive coefficients.
     - \( \theta_i \) are moving average coefficients.
     - \( \epsilon_t \) is the error term.

2. **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**

   - Addresses **non-linear relationships** in financial data.
   - Prevents **overfitting** by applying **regularisation**.
   - Objective function:

     $$
     \text{Obj}(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \Omega(f_k)
     $$

     $$
     \Omega(f_k) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2} \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{T} w_j^2
     $$

     Where:

     - \( l(y_i, \hat{y}_i) \) is the loss function.
     - \( \Omega(f_k) \) is the regularisation term.
     - \( \gamma \) and \( \lambda \) are hyperparameters controlling model complexity.

3. **Transformer-based Neural Networks**

   - Uses **self-attention mechanisms** to capture long-term dependencies.
   - Adapts well to **non-stationary and volatile** financial data.
   - Effective in modelling **complex temporal structures**.

## **4. Challenges and Learning Experiences**

Throughout the project, several challenges were encountered:

### **Handling Non-Stationary Data**

- Financial markets are inherently **dynamic**, with constantly changing statistical properties.
- Applied **differencing** and **data transformations** to stabilise the time series.

### **Overfitting and Model Generalisation**

- **Cross-validation** was implemented to improve model robustness.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV) was used to optimise model parameters.

### **Volatility of Tesla Stock**

- **Tesla’s stock price is highly volatile**, making predictions difficult.
- Applied **ensemble learning** to balance sensitivity to market fluctuations.

---

## **5. Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics**

To assess model accuracy, the following metrics were used:

1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

   - Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

     $$
     \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
     $$

2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

   - Provides an intuitive measure of prediction accuracy.

     $$
     \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
     $$

### **Model Comparison**

- **XGBoost outperformed ARIMA** in capturing **non-linear trends**.
- **Hybrid models (ARIMA + XGBoost + Transformers)** showed **marginal improvement** but required additional tuning.

## **6. Future Directions**

Several areas for improvement were identified:

### **Enhancing Feature Engineering**

- Incorporating additional features such as **macroeconomic indicators** and **sentiment analysis** from financial news articles.
- Applying **technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands)**.

### **Advanced Hyperparameter Optimisation**

- Implementing **Bayesian Optimisation** for improved hyperparameter selection.
- Expanding **GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV** trials.

### **Deep Learning Exploration**

- Experimenting with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** for capturing long-term dependencies in financial data.
- Implementing **regularisation techniques** (dropout) to prevent overfitting.
